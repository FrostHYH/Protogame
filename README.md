Protogame
=========

Protogame is an open source game engine (MIT licensed) written on top of XNA and C#, designed to allow game developers to rapidly produce games within 48 hours.

Protogame 2 is currently in development; the goals are to allow prototypes to be implemented quickly, but also permit them to evolve into fully-fledged games.
